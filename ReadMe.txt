To Use:

Open in any version of unity 2017 and greater.
The BotTest scene gives a very basic demonstration of how to connect to the Twitch IRC and receive/send messages.
StoryGenerator scene is an interactive voting system made for twitch.

You will need a separate twitch account to make this work along with the OAUTH key.
All bot settings are in the ChatBot object in both scenes. Make sure to use your own account cradentials.

Here is some good information on the twitch IRC. If you want to use this, read the article.
